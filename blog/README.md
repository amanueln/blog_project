     1. User is directed to login, logout, and signup pages as appropriate. E.g.,
        login page should have a link to signup page and vice-versa; logout page is
        only available to logged in user.

     2. Links to edit blog pages are available to users. Users editing a
        page can click on a link to cancel the edit and go back to viewing that page.

     3.Blog pages render properly. Templates are used to unify the site.
     
     4. users have MyBlog page to see only there blogs. will be able to edit and delete also.
